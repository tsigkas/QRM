Projects related to quantitative risk management done while attending the courses "Multivariate Statistics" at EPFL in R and "Financial Risk Management" at LiU. 
More specifically, the projects focus on applying and testing multivariate mean-variance mixture models, copulas and risk measurments such as VaR to time-series of stock returns.
